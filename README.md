# Halo Status Bot
A simple bot that sets which Halo CE server you are playing in as your status. A special thanks to [@yumiris](https://github.com/yumiris) for the cli to get the IP from Halo.

## Steps
1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install` inside the **Halo Status Bot** directory.
3. Edit `config.sample.js` and rename it to `config.js`
4. Run the bot `node bot.js`
